## Donald E. Crabtree Biography

*Updated from [Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab/collections/crabtree)*

Donald E. Crabtree was born in Heyburn, Idaho on June 8, 1912 to Reverend Ellis and Mabel G. Crabtree. After graduating high school in Twin Falls, Idaho in 1930, Crabtree worked for the Idaho Power Company for a brief period. He then moved to California and enrolled in Long Beach Junior College, intending to major in geology and paleontology. His interest in those topics and in prehistoric archaeology had developed during a childhood and youth spent exploring south-central Idaho. During this time, Crabtree tried flintknapping, but at the time, it was not his primary focus. After just one term, Crabtree dropped out and began working in paleontological laboratories and doing summer fieldwork in California and Nevada. 

In 1939, Crabtree was diagnosed with cancer and spent his recuperation period, when his mobility and muscular strength were limited, flintknapping, all the while learning more about lithic mechanics, systems of efficient core reduction and the significance of variations among the newly identified paleo-Indian points from the Plains and Southwest. In 1941, after fully recovering from cancer, Crabtree was invited to demonstrate flintknapping techniques at the American Association of Museums' annual meeting in Columbus, Ohio. In the fall of 1941, Crabtree returned to California to support the World War II effort, during which time he met his future wife Evelyn Josephine Meadows; they married in Long Beach in 1943. 

For the next 30 years, Crabtree continued to hone his skill and expertise in flintknapping, forming connections with researchers and flintknappers around the world. Crabtree also willingly shared his knowledge at various field schools and during informal interactions, encouraging others to learn the art and science of flintknapping. During this period, Crabtree authored or co-authored 23 scholarly articles, was featured in seven films, and led the Idaho State University National Science Foundation Flintworking School (1969-1975). 

In 1979, Crabtree’s lifelong contribution to the field of archaeology was recognized with an honorary doctorate from the University of Idaho. Since 1985, the Society for American Archaeology has also awarded the prestigious “[Crabtree Award](https://www.saa.org/career-practice/awards/crabtree-award)” to outstanding avocational archaeologists who have made significant contributions to the discipline. Crabtree died in Twin Falls, Idaho on November 16, 1980.
