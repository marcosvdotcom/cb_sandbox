## Digitization

Visit [https://awbla.github.io/awbla-student-workflow/](https://awbla.github.io/awbla-student-workflow/) to learn more about our processes and workflows for scanning, 2D photography, 3D photogrammetry, 3D model creation, processing scans, and metadata creation.

### Get Glue On It (GGOI)
From the beginning of this grant, project staff encountered difficulties digitizing the shiny stone tools in the Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Comparative Collection. Coating objects is an established norm when imaging shiny objects for photogrammetry, but these processes are usually toxic, costly, and potentially damaging to the object itself. In February 2022, the grant team developed a unique solution that addressed these issues by creating Get Glue on It (GGOI), a coating method that combined Elmer's glue and water, which results in a matte finish that doesn't obscure an object's original color. 

GGOI **should not** be used in every digitization scenario. As with common coating methods, such as developer spray or talc/corn starch powder, GGOI **should not** be used when working with artifacts/objects that have unknown provenance, those that have residue or forensic interest, or those that are too fragile to endure a wet-based application or post-application cleaning processes. 

For more information about our GGOI process, check out our demonstration video from the 2022 Digitizing Hidden Collections (DHC) Symposium.
