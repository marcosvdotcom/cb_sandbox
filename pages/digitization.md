## Digitization

Visit [https://awbla.github.io/awbla-student-workflow/](https://awbla.github.io/awbla-student-workflow/) to learn more about our processes and workflows for scanning, 2D photography, 3D photogrammetry, 3D model creation, processing scans, and metadata creation.

### Get Glue On It (GGOI)
For more information about our GGOI process, check out our demonstration video from the 2022 Digitizing Hidden Collections (DHC) Symposium. A note of caution: GGOI **should not** be used in every digitization scenario, such as when working with artifacts or items that have unknown provenance, that have residue or forensic interest, or that are too fragile to endure a wet-based application or post-application cleaning processes.
