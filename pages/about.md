## About the Project

“Digitizing the Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Comparative Collection in 2D and 3D” was supported by a Digitizing Hidden Collections grant from the [Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)](https://www.clir.org/). The grant program is made possible by funding from the Mellon Foundation. This three-year project (4/1/2021 to 3/31/2024) was a collaborative effort between the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/) and [Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology (AWBLA/Bowers Lab)](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab) to digitize the Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection. This preeminent collection includes lithic (stone) items created by Crabtree and the documents, slides, and photographs related to his work. This collection also includes unprovenanced lithic artifacts created by Native and Indigenous people, artifacts which Crabtree surface collected or which were given to him by others.

As we sought to open up this hidden collection, it became evident that we would need to engage in difficult conversations. Even if we only considered the lithic items Crabtree created, there is no doubt that he was inspired by and learned from Native and Indigenous knowledge, practices, and people, both directly and via the study of artifacts. Acknowledging that Crabtree could not have created these unique and innovative items without first learning from Native and Indigenous people challenges the incorrect and pervasive belief that knowledge cannot be culturally appropriated if it is used in a “positive” way and separated from its source. Furthermore, although the majority of these lithic items are Crabtree’s creations, this collection does include unprovenanced Native and Indigenous artifacts gathered via surface collection or via gifts from colleagues, artifacts whose histories and creators are unknown to us. This knowledge has compelled the grant team to find ways to constructively critique this collection and its themes, most clearly through our interviews with Advisory Board members. With this critique, we sought to be candid about cultural and knowledge appropriation and surface collecting or looting within archaeological practice and avocational flintknapping as well as push archaeology and librarianship toward greater honesty and openness when creating digital collections.

In total, this project website includes 2D photos of # of lithic items created by Crabtree; # of unprovenanced lithic items created by Native and Indigenous peoples; and # of documents, photos, and slides. This website also includes 3D models of # of lithic items created by Crabtree; these models can be viewed on the site as well as downloaded for printing.

This website was built with assistance from the [University of Idaho’s Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) and was generated using CollectionBuilder, an open source, minimal infrastructure platform developed by a team of librarians at the University of Idaho.

## Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection

The [Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab/collections/crabtree) is a unique representation of Donald Crabtree’s (1912-1980) global impact and his lifelong work with lithic technology. From age 8 until his death at 68, Crabtree’s experimental flintknapping helped increase society’s understanding of our species’ earliest identifiable human technology. Crabtree was recognized as a master stone worker by the 1930s, but it wasn’t until the 1960s that his work became a staple in the academic community. Upon his death in 1980, Crabtree bequeathed his entire collection to the University of Idaho Department of Anthropology, where it has been managed by the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology. The Crabtree Collection, consisting of lithic items he created as well as Crabtree’s archives (documents, slides, photographs, negatives, etc.), comprises the most complete collection of his work. This collection also includes unprovenanced lithic artifacts created by Native and Indigenous people, artifacts which Crabtree surface collected or which were given to him by others. The items in this collection serve a dual purpose in the study of lithic technology as they demonstrate Crabtree’s creativity and innovation in flintknapping as well as reflect the knowledge and practices of Indigenous people from around the world, including North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan.

## Donald E. Crabtree Biography

*Updated from [Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab/collections/crabtree)*

Donald E. Crabtree was born in Heyburn, Idaho on June 8, 1912 to Reverend Ellis and Mabel G. Crabtree. After graduating high school in Twin Falls, Idaho in 1930, Crabtree worked for the Idaho Power Company for a brief period. He then moved to California and enrolled in Long Beach Junior College, intending to major in geology and paleontology. His interest in those topics and in prehistoric archaeology had developed during a childhood and youth spent exploring south-central Idaho. During this time, Crabtree tried flintknapping, but at the time, it was not his primary focus. After just one term, Crabtree dropped out and began working in paleontological laboratories and doing summer fieldwork in California and Nevada. In 1939, Crabtree was diagnosed with cancer and spent his recuperation period, when his mobility and muscular strength were limited, flintknapping, all the while learning more about lithic mechanics, systems of efficient core reduction and the significance of variations among the newly identified paleo-Indian points from the Plains and Southwest. In 1941, after fully recovering from cancer, Crabtree was invited to demonstrate flintknapping techniques at the American Association of Museums' annual meeting in Columbus, Ohio. In the fall of 1941, Crabtree returned to California to support the World War II effort, during which time he met his future wife Evelyn Josephine Meadows; they married in Long Beach in 1943. 

For the next 30 years, Crabtree continued to hone his skill and expertise in flintknapping, forming connections with researchers and flintknappers around the world. Crabtree also willingly shared his knowledge at various field schools and during informal interactions, encouraging others to learn the art and science of flintknapping. During this period, Crabtree authored or co-authored 23 scholarly articles, was featured in seven films, and led the Idaho State University National Science Foundation Flintworking School (1969-1975). In 1979, Crabtree’s lifelong contribution to the field of archaeology was recognized with an honorary doctorate from the University of Idaho. Since 1985, the Society for American Archaeology has also awarded the prestigious “[Crabtree Award](https://www.saa.org/career-practice/awards/crabtree-award)” to outstanding avocational archaeologists who have made significant contributions to the discipline. Crabtree died in Twin Falls, Idaho on November 16, 1980.
